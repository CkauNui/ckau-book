## What is this project about?

<p>
Forked from awesome <a href="https://github.com/CkauNui/ckau-book">ckau-book</a> theme, <strong>ckau-book-enhanced</strong> expands the original theme by embracing more and more systems in both COLORFUL and DARKFUL variations.<br/>
The ultimate goal of the project is to support all of Batocera and Retrobat systems in both variations, and contribute to the development of ckau-book theme by anticipating changes and improvements.<br/>
